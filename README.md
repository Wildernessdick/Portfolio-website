## 15 Puzzle Game

The 15 puzzle game featured on my website is a school project from the first web development class I took at the University of Applied Sciences. It was created using JavaScript and CSS. The game involves sliding tiles around on a board to arrange them in numerical order, and it can be quite challenging!

own repo: [15 puzzle](https://github.com/Wildernessdick/WEB1-15puzzle)

## Code

The website consists of multiple CSS and JavaScript files to help manage and organize the codebase.
Here's an overview of the files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.

### CSS

- `site.css` for the website, containing the majority of the website's styles.
- `mail.css` for the "maill form" on the website. Work on progress....
- `navbar.css` for the navigation bar on the bottom of the website.
- `15game.css` for the 15 puzzle game.

### JS

- `site.js`: A JavaScript file containing common logic used throughout the website.
- ~~`mail.js` the logic for the contact form on the website.~~
- `navbar.js` for the navigation bar on the website.
- `15game.js` for the 15 puzzle game on the website.

## Installation
